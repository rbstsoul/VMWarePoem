# VMWare Poem
A poem for VMWare by Eymen Sevil.

What a good day
Nothing bad happens
Then something called
VMWare appears
They were just trying to
Manage servers
But the hackers from Iran
They destroyed

I waaant toooo
Open my server!
Users wait fooooor
An everyone announcement

We must stay strong
Else they will kill us
Our determination is still up
No giving up
